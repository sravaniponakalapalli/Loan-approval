# Loan-approval
## Objective
The objective of the loan approval project is to create an automated system that can accurately predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on various applicant characteristics and 
financial information.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: Loan Status Prediction Dataset. It includes information about loan applicants, such as their income, credit score, loan amount, and loan status.
## Tools and Technoligies used
1. Python: Utilized for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model development due to its rich ecosystem of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.
2. Jupyter Notebooks: Employed for interactive data analysis and model prototyping, facilitating collaboration and documentation of the analysis process.
3. Machine Learning Libraries: Leveraged frameworks such as scikit-learn for building and training machine learning models.
4. Data Visualization Tools: Employed tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations to gain insights into the data and present findings.
## Data cleaning
Data cleaning refers to the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in a dataset.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring loan approval data to answer key questions such as:
-  What is the distribution of the target variable (loan approval status)?
-  What are the characteristics of the applicants in the dataset?
-  Are there any correlations between applicant characteristics and loan approval status?
-  How do numerical variables (e.g., income, credit score) vary between approved and denied loans?
## Models
We experimented with different machine learning models, including logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM).
## Results
The results of the trained models are evaluated using accuracy as the metric. We visualize the accuracy of each model using bar plots in the notebook
